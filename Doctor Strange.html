	  <h5><u>Introduction</u></h5>
	  <p>From the Marvel Cinematic Universe movie vault, Doctor Strange is the 14th movie in the collection released in 2016. Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange) was a brilliant neurosurgeon with a photographic memory. Today, Doctor Strange is the Sorcerer Supreme and a member of the Masters of the Mystic Arts. He is Earth's protector from magical and mystical threats. The villain in this movie is Kaecilius. Kaecilius is also a great sorcerer andformer member of the Masters of the Mystic Arts. </p>
    <h5><u>Plot</u></h5>
	  <p>In present day, Doctor Strange is performing surgery. Afterwards, he is seen getting ready for an important dinner. On his way there, Strange gets into a serious car accident and his hands are crushed. Even though he lives, his hands are permanently damaged and probably never perform surgery again. His life will never be the same again.</p>
	  <p>Doctor Strange desperately starts looking for a way to heal his hands. After spending his fortune on failed attempts, he is financially broke. He is finally able to track down a patient (Jonathan Pangborn) who had miraculously regained his ability to walk. Jonathan said he learned magic to walk again. He was cured in Nepal, at a place called Damar-Taj. With his remaining money, he buys a ticket to Nepal. During his stay in Damar-Taj, he starts healing his hands and learning the mystic arts and how to bend time and space. He would soon become a great sorcerer.</p>
    <p>Damar-Taj comes under attack by Kaecilius. He plans to attack the London, New York, and Hong Kong Sanctums. The sanctums store mystical items and defend Earth from mystical threats. During the attack, Doctor Strange finds himself trapped in the New York Sanctum. Kaecilius wants to kill Strange and destroy the sanctum. However, Strange is able to stop and trap Kaecilius. He tells Strange that everything on Earth eventually dies. Together, they can find a way to live forever with the help of Dormammu. Dormammu is an interdimensional entity and ruler of the Dark Dimension. Distracted, Doctor Strange is stabbed by one of the bad guys. Fortunately, Doctor Strange escapes, finds medical help, and recovers.</p>
    <p>Afterwards, Kaecilius heads to the Hong Kong Sanctum. When Doctor Strange arrives, it's too late. The sanctum is already destroyed. Realizing Dormammu was about to arrive, Doctor Strange uses his powers to reverse time and puts things back the way they were before the attack. He then flies off to defend Earth from Dormammu. Strange tries to convince Dormammu not to attack Earth. Dormammu won't hear it and immediately kills Strange. However, Strange ability to control time allows him to go back in time before he is killed over and over again. Dormammu gets fed up, loses patience, and gives in to Strange. Dormammu and Kaecilius are defeated and the world is saved.</p>
	  <h5><u>Conclusion</u></h5>
	  <p>This is another great movie based on fictional characters brought to life from Marvel Comics. There is plenty of non-stop action and humor through out the movie. I recommend this movie for the whole family. I give Doctor Strange a solid Five Star Rating.</p>

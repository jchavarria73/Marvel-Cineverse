	  <h5><u>Introduction</u></h5>
	  <p>From the Marvel Cinematic Universe collection, Ant-Man is my favorite movie of all time. Ant-Man (Scott Lang) is an ex-convict and electronics expert. Ant-Man uses a special suit that allows him to shrink to the size of an insect and gives him the unique ability to telepathically control an army of ants. The villain in this movie is the Yellowjacket, who also has a special suit that allows him to shrink to the size of an insect.</p>
	  <h5><u>Plot</u></h5>
	  <p>At the beginning of the movie, Scott Lang leaves prison and reunites with Luis, his ex-cellmate and best friend. Luis wants Scott to break into a wealthy mansion. However, Scott Lang just wants to reconnect with his daughter, Cassie. His life quickly turns out to be a financial disaster and jobless. He decides to take Luis up on his offer. In the mansion, Scott finds a special suit, steals it, and his life will never be the same again. Hank Pym, the creator of the Ant-Man suit, asks Scottâ€™s for his help. Hank needs to stop Darren Cross, his former assistant, from creating a special shrinking suit of his own called the Yellowjacket. Cross's intentions are evil and plans on taking over the world. Scott agrees to help Hank stop Cross. Hank and his daughter, Hope van Dyne, train Scott to become the Ant-Man. During the theft of the Yellowjacket suit, everything was going as planned until Cross traps the Ant Man. The Ant-Man finds a way to break free and fights the Yellowjacket in a battle to the finish. In the end, the Yellowjacket is defeated and Ant-Man lives to fight another day</p>
	  <h5><u>Conclusion</u></h5>
	  <p>I love this movie. I was really captured and fascinated by the way Ant-Man shrunk to the size of an insect. This movie is by far my favorite Marvel movie of all time. I recommend all Marvel fans watch this movie. I give Ant-Man a Five Star Rating.</p>

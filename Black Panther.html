 <h5><u>Introduction</u></h5>
 <p>From the Marvel Cinematic Universe movie vault, <i>Black Panther</i> is the 18th movie in the collection released in 2018. Black Panther (T'Challa) is the 
 rightful king of the African kingdom Wakanda. When he wears an armored suit made from Vibranium, he becomes the Black Panther. The suit makes him almost indestructible. By drinking the Heart-shaped Herb, only found in Wakanda, the Black Panther gains super-human strength, speed, and instincts. The villain in this movie is Erik Killmonger. He is a highly trained military assassin and mercenary. He also gets to wear an armored suit made from Vibranium and also drank the Heart-shaped Herb that gave him superhuman strength, speed, and instincts.</p>
 <h5><u>Plot</u></h5>
 <p>Millions of years ago, a meteor made from Vibranium is seen hurling towards Earth. It landed on the fictional African country of Wakanda. Vibranium is the hardest metal on Earth that absorbs, stores, and releases large amount of kinetic energy. Vibranium gave Wakanda a huge technical advantage and became far more advanced than the rest of the world. They hid themselves and their technology from the world.</p>
 <p>In 1992, King T'Chaka suspects his brother, N'Jobu, is a traitor. He suspects N'Jobu has stolen and sold Vibranium to a black-market arms dealer known as Ulysses Klaue. During the confrontation, T'Chaka kills his brother. To cover up his death, N'Jobu's son, Erik Stevens, is abandoned at a young age and forced to fend for himself. Erik Stevens, a.k.a. Erik Killmonger, grew up to be a highly trained military assassin and mercenary. </p>
 <p>In present day, the movie moves on to the scene where Prince T'Challa accepts and becomes Wakanda's new king and Black Panther. At the same time, Killmonger makes his own appearance. Klaue and Killmonger steal a Vibranium ax from a museum in London. While trying to sell the ax, Klaue is captured. Killmonger rescues Klaue and surprisingly kills him. Klaue was a wanted man in Wakanda for stealing Vibranium and killing Wakandan citizens. Killmonger returns to Wakanda with Klaue's body. He demands a challenge for the throne since he is T'Challa's cousin and a Wakandan prince. Killmonger, looking to avenge his father's death, defeats T'Challa and throws his body over a raging water fall. Unfortunately, Killmonger becomes Wakanda's new king and Black Panther. Like his father, he wants to liberate black people around the world. He has ordered the shipment of weapons to Wakandans already operating in the real world. He wants to overthrow governments, start a war, and become the world's leader. However, T'Challa had survived the fall and reappears. T'Chaka claims he never yielded and the challenge must go on. As a result, a huge battle starts between those loyal to Killmonger and those loyal to T'Challa. Both dressed in Black Panther suits, T'Challa and Erik battle to an epic end. This time, T'Challa defeats and kills Killmonger.</p>
 <h5><u>Conclusion</u></h5>
 <p>This is another great movie for the whole family. There is non-stop action from start to finish. In 2019, <i>Black Panther</i> was nominated for seven Academy Awards and Best Picture. It won three Academy Awards. I recommend everyone watch this movie. I give the <i>Black Panther</i> a solid <i>Five Star Rating.</i></p>
